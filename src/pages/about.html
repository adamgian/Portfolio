            Hello, my name is Adam and I’m a front end developer that dabbles in design. I appreciate, drool over, respect, value — and strive to create beautifully crafted, performant web products.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a developer, always looking for the best approach when implementing designs to maximise scalability, maintainability and performance. Committed to typing lovely, logical code which conforms to best practices. As a designer, focused on creating clean, minimal designs centred on user interaction and experience
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy the satisfaction of doing my bit towards building a better web. Constantly learning and on the lookout for things which improves my code, designs and workflow. Currently based in Brisbane, Australia.
